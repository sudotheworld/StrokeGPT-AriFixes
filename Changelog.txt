====================
    CHANGELOG
====================

=== v1.5 - The Refactor & Interactivity Update ===

- Major Architectural Overhaul: The entire application was refactored from a single mahoosive file into a multi-module structure. This makes it more stable and easier to update in the future. (I wept a little.)
- New Feature: Advanced Interactive Edging Mode! The old, predictable loop is gone. Edging is now a proper game:
    - A new "I'm Close" button lets you signal the AI when you're near the edge.
    - The AI is now unpredictable and will react to your signal by choosing to pull back, hold you on the edge, or even push you a little further.
    - Chat messages sent during any mode (Auto, Milking, Edging) will now influence the AI's behavior in real-time.
- New Feature: AI-Aware Edging Timer - A timer now appears during edging, and the AI is aware of it, allowing it to comment on your performance.
- New Feature: Custom AI Name & Profile Picture - You can now set a custom name and upload a profile picture for the AI in the sidebar. The name replaces "BOT" in the chat.
- UI Overhaul: The entire interface has been polished with a more modern design, better fonts, softer elements, and smoother animations.
- Collapsible Sidebar: The sidebar can now be hidden to focus on the chat.
- Added an AI typing indicator and animated messages to make the chat feel more alive.
- The title has been updated to the much sleeker "StrokeGPT".
- Added a few secret chat commands and naming conventions for users with particular tastes in classic gaming.
- CRITICAL SAFETY FIX: The "Stop" command is now top priority and will correctly interrupt all modes, including the new interactive edging mode.
- Fixed a persistent bug that caused the onboarding wizard to appear on every startup.
- Fixed numerous issues where the AI would stop moving if it received an incomplete command from a user's request.
- Massively improved the AI's long-term memory. It should no longer get confused about who is who or forget details from the chat (still not perfect).
- The "Like" button now actually works and saves patterns correctly.
- Jeez, that was a lot...

=== v1.4.1 ===

- The AI can now focus on working the entire shaft.
- Noted the app/index files so hard their future generations will walk with a limp.

=== v1.4 ===

- New Feature: Edging Mode has been added.
- New Feature: Added user-configurable timers in the UI to control the interval between moves in all special modes (Auto, Edging, Milking).
- AI now invents every move on the fly. Clicking the Like button saves the move to memory for future use.
- The more likes a move gets, the more often it will be used.
- The memory system has been overhauled to use a detailed user profile, which saves important info, personal details, and key memories from your sessions.
- The AI's persona can now be changed at any time from the sidebar during a chat.
- All special modes (Auto, Milking, Edging) now function as intended, inventing moves dynamically and respecting user settings.
- The Stop command is now more reliable.
- Chatting during special modes is now safe and will not interrupt the active mode.
- Added min/max speed settings to the onboarding guide.
- System prompt has been optimized, which may improve response speed on some hardware.

=== v1.3 – The update that borked the app :/ ===

- New Feature: Onboarding Setup – The app now starts with a simple guide to set your Handy key, choose a persona, and define your min/max depth.
- Smarter AI Depth Mapping: The calibration system ensures the AI understands your physical range, so it no longer confuses the tip with the base.
- Persona Consistency: The AI now strictly adheres to the persona you choose.
- Voice Update: ElevenLabs voice output is more stable and expressive.
- Improved Depth Semantics: Commands like just the tip or go deeper are now understood more reliably.
- Emergency Stop Fix: The STOP EVERYTHING button now correctly halts all motion.
- Memory Saving Fix: Memory snapshots now save correctly without overwriting each other.

=== v1.2.5 - Depth Adherence & Stability Hotfix ===


=== v1.2 - The Ergonomics & Audio Update ===

- New Feature: ElevenLabs Integration: Added full voice support, with settings for API key and voice selection.
- New Feature: Advanced In-Session Memory: Added a smarter way for the AI to remember what's happening during your chat.
- UI Overhaul: Redesigned the app with a two-column layout, moving settings to the sidebar for a larger chat window.
- Model Recommendation Update: The recommended AI model is now llama3:8b-instruct-q4_K_M for better speed and comprehension.
- Fixed AI Depth Understanding: Made it so tip, mid, and deep strokes are accurate regardless of your Max Depth setting.
- Fixed AI Speed Perception: Improved the AI's understanding of slow, medium, and fast speeds for better control.
- Introduced Max Depth Limiter: Added a Max Depth slider and a hard safety limit in the code to ensure the device never goes past your set depth.
- Resolved UI Interactivity Issues: Fixed code so all buttons and sliders work correctly.
- Fixed Preference Saving Errors: Corrected issues that prevented settings from saving properly when closing the app.
